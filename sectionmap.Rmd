For our project we used a dataset from the [City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Data/4fs7-3vj5). Using this data, we developed 4 visualizations that examined different aspects of homicide data ranging back to 2009. Additionally, we provided users to filter the data further by specifying the police sector and date range they desired. The first stacked bar chart displays the count of each specific type of homicide committed based off neighborhoods. The second chart is used to examine the hour of when each homicide was committed. The third plot displays only the counts of homicides in relation to each neighborhood in the filtered section. Lastly, the final plot is another represtation of the 3rd plot but structured in a pie chart.
